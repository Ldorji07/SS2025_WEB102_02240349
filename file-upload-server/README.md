# Practical 3: File Upload on the Server Application

## 📌 Overview

This practical focuses on enabling server-side file uploads using **Express.js** and **Multer**, with a React/Next.js frontend. The goal was to build a secure and reliable system where users can upload files (like PDFs), which are then validated and stored on the server.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Node.js / Express.js** – Server-side framework
- **Multer** – Handles multipart/form-data
- **CORS** – Enables cross-origin requests
- **Axios** – For HTTP requests from the frontend
- **React / Next.js** – Frontend UI and logic
